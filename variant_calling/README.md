# MxO_GeneticMap

## Variant Calling Pipeline

Steps for completing the variant calling pipeline

-   [x]  Create indexed references for Stevens and NJ96-20

-   [ ] Align reads to both genomes using BWA

-   [ ] Use freebayes to call SNPs based on both alignments

-   [ ] Filter SNPs

-   [ ] Construct genetic maps using SNPs from either alignment

-   [ ]
